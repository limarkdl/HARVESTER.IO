# HARVESTER.IO

HARVESTER.IO is a small project that serves the purpose to simplify farmers' life by displaying interactive grid of fields, 
that allows to clearly see following information, that has been received from a special distribution algorithm:

Field's ID, Field's crop, Field's crop density, Field's relief complexity, Assigned harvester(s), Harvester('s/s') header(s), and Current progress

This is actually a mockup for a possible Web App's appearance.

Live demo is available on 'https://limarkdl.github.io/HARVESTER.IO/'
